# Surfs Up
## Overview:
An investor wants to learn more about the weather before committing to build a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The investor's main concern is the precipitation forcing the shop to close too frequently. To analyze Hawaii's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to:
- query the SQLite database. 
- Project to analyze weather data of an area where the an inestor is looking to invest in a surf and ice cream shop.

## Purpose:
Explain the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.
Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
Design a Flask application using data.

## Results:

The mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December. However, the opposite is true for precipitation. December had the higher precipitation of .22 inches while June had .14 inches.

Summary:
The investor's main concern was getting frequent rains and therefore disrupted business. Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures and precipitation means are reasonably close. The temperature data is not strongly skewed for either month. I would say the data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round at this point.
